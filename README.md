Official Repository for the Team 5810 Xbots Robotics Team. Based in Java. Created by John Pace on 01/13/2020
We are going to maintain the current branches. The master is the most current branch. 
I am going to update the John Branch, Eugene, you are going to update the Eugene branch. 
Later when we plan to calibrate, we will convert to the master branch, pull both the Eugene and JOhn branches together 
and call it a day.
